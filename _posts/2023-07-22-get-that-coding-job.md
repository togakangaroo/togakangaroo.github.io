# Preface

So far during my career, I've designed software developer hiring processes at three different companies. I've personally conducted a couple hundred interviews, I've run teams that have conducted thousands, I've written staffing software, and I've spoken on hiring at conferences. I also have mentored people for fifteen years, and am involved in several online organizations based around helping people progress or move into tech. And while CTO at [Operation Spark](https://www.operationspark.org/) bootcamp, I spent months helping run the job hunt phase of the program. In one form or another, I think about this stuff every day, and so people ask me for job hunt advice a lot.

I've been meaning to write this article for a long time and I've got 6000 words of notes alone; so before we launch into this tome, let me just say that I very much acknowledge that my own experience is very much *not* that of someone trying to break through out of school or bootcamp. At this point, its not even similar to most senior developers. In addition, even expert advice on an activity which is performed relatively infrequently and with long delays for feedback, is precisely the sort [flagged by researchers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow) as being not much better than random.

Yet people keep asking me for advice on job hunt. And I do think that over the years I have developed a set of mostly common sense things that I tell people, and they do seem to find helpful.

We're going to cover the mental model of what I'm arguing for and the view from the hiring manager's side in this post, then ins subsequent ones we'll go into thoughts on resumes, interviewing, and job hunt strategy. There's a lot and there's a limit to how much you should listen to me, but here it is.

# Mindset

Let's not be shy about this, Job hunt is a Sisyphean task.

Except of course it is not. Sisyphus was the ancient Greek king damned to eternally roll a boulder uphill. A thing can only be Sisyphean if it is impossible to attain your goals. Otherwise, it is just hard. And job hunting is hard. You are best served getting into the right frame of mind.

Fortunately, it is not hard because you have to push a heavy boulder. It is hard because every part of the job hunt will be all about failure. Sure, in the end you suddenly achieve your goals, but right up till then...well it sucks.

But what if job hunt is **not primarily** about that?

Writing code, doing projects, being a good coworker. These are all important and valuable skills. But it's not the full set of skills needed to get the job. [There is a different set](https://pbfcomics.com/comics/sisyphus-myth/). Your *primary* goal is to build up these job-hunt skills?

Before we launch into that list though, let's consider the structure of a job hunt.

## The Funnel

At its core, a job hunt is marketing, is it not? You are marketing yourself.

Have you ever heard marketing or sales people talk about "the funnel"? The idea is that opportunities pass through a series of stages. At each stage a decision is made and the opportunity either progresses or gets eliminated and falls out of the funnel. From a hiring manager's point of view, each applicant is an opportunity and - as they move through the process - at each stage the number of remaining applicants gets smaller. From the applicant's point of view, at each successive stage the chances of them reaching the end, and an offer, increases.

So its really more of a sieve than a funnel, but I guess marketing folk aren't known for their nomenclature. (Also feel free to visualize this as a video game...but like, without checkpoints and you never get a chainsaw.)

During the job hunt, with each job application, you enter a funnel. Here is a rough list of stages you have to get through:

- **Your resume needs to get looked at.** That means someone has to actually be manning the hiring apparatus. You'll be shocked how often things have there's simply not someone on the other side. I would wager this is the case with 20-50% of all job postings.
- Alternately, **they might have gotten so many resumes that they simply couldn't review every one**. I encourage hiring managers in that position to pick at random a comfortable number of resumes they actually can review and mass-reject the rest. It sucks, but it sucks less than any alternative.
- Next, **your resume should stack up well enough against others to be selected for a phone screen**.
- Of course you have to be able to carry on a conversation and demonstrate some competence in a **phone screen and to be passed through to an interview**.
- Then there's the **rounds of interview** - each a stage in itself. Let's be conservative and say there are three rounds. The details don't matter so much for the purposes of this list. Lets say these include **a technical conversation** with the hiring manager, a **leetcode-style coding test**, and **a behavioral interview panel**. At each point you might get eliminated as your performance always has a chance of not matching expectations.
- Now say that you get to the end of the interview process...well that's no guarantee you **get an offer**! There are other people also moving through the process. If they did it correctly, only a couple should reach the end; the offer usually goes to just one.
- Then of course the **offer has to be good enough** that you're willing to take it.
- And finally, at every point in time there's the small, yet real **possibility of the job simply disappearing**, hiring being frozen, the hiring manager or recruiter leaving, or people just plain dropping the ball.

This list is key to understand and we will revisit it throughout this series. There are things you can do to improve your odds at just about any stage, but you have to prioritize. Time spent improving in one area is time not spent on another. You have to learn how to think about these odds and how they interact. Unless you're an ace at Bayesian probability, **your intuition here is probably wrong**.

</figure>

Which is why, after the 50th time I've had a conversation with a mentee about how the odds don't play out like they think, [I created a tool to help](http://georgemauer.net/job-hunt-simulator/)! You make a [Fermi estimate](https://brilliant.org/wiki/fermi-estimate/) for your odds representing all the above stages and it interactively runs thousands of simulations to show you how that job hunt might go.

Its crude and purposefully worksheet-esque as I want people to focus on the relative impact of certain variables compared to others, but the math isn't complex and I think it demonstrates these things well. I'll be referring to this a lot throughout as well.

## Job Hunt Skills

Now if you have amazing, preexisting marketing and sales skills you probably don't need to hear any of this. If you are incredible at networking and can cold-call sell a wool coat to a sheep, you don't need my advice and you should just go do the things you already know how to do far better than I. But for the rest of you (or the marketing wizes who are reading this for "research", good for you), lets talk about what I mean by "job hunt skills".

> *“There’s nothing to applying at all. All I need to do is tailor my resume and click submit.”*
>  -- a mentee

Yeah, it's not that simple. What is this entirely different set of skills anyways? Let's do another list.

- Goal setting and sticking to a schedule. Including the ability to set small-yet-achievable short-term goals, set commitments, do regular accountability check-ins, and adjust as needed.

  This is the key to improving at *most things* and rarely something - outside of practicing sports or music - that people do explicitly.

- Ability to find jobs to simply find apply to.

  Ever look at a job board and dejectedly feel like none of these listings are a fit? It's not just you. This influences the rate at which you fill up that funnel and how many chances at this stuff per week do you get.

- The mere act of applying is an emotional roller coaster. You have to put yourself out there, you get hopeful, open up yourself to dejection.

  As humans, we try to avoid these situations. You have to desensitize yourself so that it simply doesn't sting so bad. Again this directly influences that front-of-funnel, how frequently you will need to take breaks, and the likelihood of you giving up and walking away from the whole thing. No one **wants** to apply to 3000 jobs and you very likely won't have to, but wouldn't it be nice if such a high number didn't give you all-night indigestion?

- You have to get to a point where it is easy to write and talk about yourself.

  It's not a natural thing for most people, yet what much of the interview and application process consists of. Getting good at this is going to affect most of your process. Your application, phone screen, interviews are in no small part exactly this!

- Following up.

  This is key to get people to actually pick up and look at your resume where they otherwise might not.

- Cold reach-out.

  Contacting individuals you do not know, requesting favors of connections or information can often feel socially prohibitive. Yet it is key to several networking strategies that increase your chances during interviews and ensure that you are applying to jobs where you are likely to be considered. It is a worthwhile tool to have in your pocket

- Researching companies and industries.

  Most people have no idea how to do real research. It's not ten minutes browsing the company website. Understanding how to join communities and how to conduct informational/reverse interviews are key here and take a decent amount of practice.

- The ability to have engaging conversation live and asking good questions.

  Of course a must for interview, phone screen, and offer stages as well as supporting techniques in many others. In these post-COVID pandemic days, we all need some work to improve here.

- Ability to talk about technology.

  It's great that you know X, Y, and Z. But can you actually demonstrate it live in a conversation? When the questions people ask are not those you practiced in terms that are different than what you might be used to?

- Leetcode-style coding. Or live-coding, or take-home-project coding.

  Well you knew this would be on the list as it affects those interview stages, but you're probably surprised how small a proportion of this list it really is.

- Network building and maintenance

  The core of "networking". **How** do you actually "build a network"? What is one? How do you use it? How do you tend it and grow it?

  This again, affects the few stages at the front of your funnel directly and all others indirectly. For example in the course of networking, you will get lots of practice talking to people in industry. Surely that will affect interviews as well!

This is a lot - almost an overwhelming amount - of stuff! Most of it is outside most people's comfort zone. So how do we climb a mountain like this when it is both uncomfortable and emotionally draining? Habit and organization are key


# You have to get organized

Yeah, ironically this advice is to you but not the companies you're applying to. It sucks, but - as I mentioned above - for some significant proportion of job postings you have no real chance no matter how good your job hunt skills are.

There's a saying in advertising that half of all money spent on it is wasted, the problem is that you don't know which half. The same is going to (with some caveats) apply hear as well. And if we're taking lessons from marketing, then what did the advertising industry do in the late 90s to deal with this conundrum? Well, with adtech, they started to...

## Track everything

If your primary goal is to build up job hunting skills, your **secondary goal** is to gather data that can be used to guide you further in the job hunting process.

I've been paying a lot of attention recently on a forum of dozens of very high-level and senior people looking for and sharing job hunting tips. Here is an example of the sort of thing they are regularly posting.

<<Snakey diagram image>>

Now your numbers will of course be very different, but at a bare minimum this is the sort of thing you should be able to generate at any point in time and with little effort. Note this does not mean - as people have told me in the past - "I can check my email and see where I applied" or "well Indeed has this nice tool to show you what stage you're at". You have access to a lot more data than such tools offer.

Remember those weekly accountability and commitment meetings I mentioned? Well these work best if you can set goals and discuss success in terms of numbers. Ideally, all of the following are things that you should be able to give weekly updates on.

- Exactly how many places you've applied, in the past week? Ever?
- Exactly which stage in the process are you with each application.
- Where have you followed up and when?
- Which cover letter and/or resume did you use for every job application? If they have a custom form with essay questions, what exactly did you put in there?
- What industry is the company in and what they do? How large is the company?
- How excited you are about the opportunity? (Putting a number to this is great when you are determining how to prioritize follow-ups!)
- Which skills are the jobs you are looking at demanding? Which are seen as nice-to-haves?

  Note that this especially presents an opportunity to make data work for you. If you can code, you should code! Don't just copy-paste, standardize things. If you have a category for "Javascript" and they're asking for "ReactJs" or "Node", then that still counts as Javascript. You should be making bar charts of this stuff and using this to guide what you invest your time into!

This is all starting to sound a lot like a spreadsheet, does it not? Probably a good idea to have one.

Ultimately it's a good thing though. With this get-the-data framing, you take the terrifying prospect of hundreds of job applications and convert it into a positive source of much-needed data.

Yes, all this means That you are not going to get a job within the first six weeks of job hunt. Forget about that prospect. First, you need data.

## It's all about cadence

Here is the general shape of the job-hunt I am proposing:

First, you find a schedule that you can stick to. Next, you find a baseline of what sort of effort you can maintain long term.

In its simplest form, you want to be able to say something like "I have maintained it for a while and I know that I can apply to X amount of jobs per week without breaking a sweat." `X` is going to be different for you than for others, it can be very low or quite high, and it **should not be guessed at**; you need to have actual numbers on a spreadsheet of your experience that you can point to. And you absolutely need to know what `X` is, because once you do, you can start tweaking.

Now remember the aforementioned accountability meetings? You want those. Use a mentor, your school/bootcamp, a friend, a group of others on the job search, or even a formal [Job Search Council](https://www.phyl.org/join-jsc). At each meeting, you review your week, review your numbers blame-free, make any adjustments (eg. is `X` actually lower/higher than you initially proposed?) and commit to some goals for your next week. What goals you ask? Well, this is where the tweaking comes in. Say your number `X` is 25. You know, that using a reasonable amount of effort, in the time available, you could certainly apply to 25 jobs each week. You decide that you want to increase the odds that your resume is actually looked at. Follow-ups are exactly such a tool as we'll discuss. They can be time intensive however, and require their own set of skills to get working effectively. What if for next week you committed to scaling back to only 15 job applications, but you did 5 followups to jobs you applied to over the previous two weeks? In the following week, can you go back up to 20 job applications, while maintaining the follow ups?

A cadence gives you a ratchet to improvement. Be honest with yourself and set your goals well, and you will always be improving.

Finally here, I'd like to address the focus on job applications versus other strategies. I emphasize with the desire to avoid an activity that is for most deeply ego-bruising, but lets be honest, ultimately all roads lead to Rome. Applying to jobs is the surest way to make sure that you actually do something measurable, it works as a last ditch effort, and frankly - it trains you quite well on many of the skills you'll need to succeed in other areas of the job hunt. There is really only one thing that you **must do** to get pretty much any job: You have to apply.

# The reality from the hiring manager's side

There is a few things helpful to understand about the other side of the table.

First, job postings. I assume you've heard are rarely lists of concrete requirements. Understand that what happens a lot of the time is that you have an overworked manager or team lead who is asking repeatedly for help. Eventually - after navigating all sorts of internal politics - they manage to get approval to hire. An HR representatives asks them what they need and ask what exactly they need. The manager looks around and replies with a list of tech that is a combination of what they are using (since they likely won't have too much time to onboard) and things they are having issues with and desperately wish someone would take that problem off their hands.

HR takes that, slaps a custom preamble on, and posts the job, sending the hiring manager a link to the opportunity in Lever or in Greenhouse or Indeed or some other ATS wishing them the best of luck.

Note that first, the job posting is rarely well thought through. A decent amount of hiring is for teams and projects that don't even exist yet. It's hardly surprising that some postings will ask for the moon. Now as hiring kicks into gear, the organization will often get a better idea of what they want, yet the hiring manager often has relatively little control over the job posting itself. Even when organizationally there isn't an HR department to get in the way, they might simply not know where or have no access to edit it. They will very often have no control over where a posting appears after it's been picked up by job description reposting services, and no power to make updates.

<aside>
  <p>
    If you are yourself green, consider what this means. Requirements are not what they seem; they are all too often wish lists. You've probably heard before that you should limit yourself only to job postings that match your skills exactly. That is true! It is rarely a well thought through hard line. As a guideline, a completely green developer will usually have a chance at a role when they ask for 2 or fewer years of experience; a developer with a few years and confidence will have a chance at anything requesting senior skills/5+ years; and beyond that it doesn't matter.
  </p>
</aside>

A hiring manager also almost always has other priorities. It is relatively rare that just because you are doing a hiring cycle you have less "other" work. The essence of managerial work is after all such that you usually cannot easily offload it. It is therefore perfectly possible that the ATS goes for days or even weeks unchecked.

Worse, the manager might never have been trained on the ATS. This is surprisingly common and my personal favorite experience here was when I was asked to take over resume screening and first-round interviews at [company name redacted]. After 4 weeks, resumes were coming in a trickle - a couple a week at most. This was very surprising and I checked and re-checked that our job posting had no red flags, was actually appearing in online searches, and there was nothing on Glassdoor to scare people off too bad. I was flummoxed as were others I consulted with. That is, until I found a whole section of the Lever ATS bursting with resumes! People *were* applying, simply most were hidden on the default candidate-review screen. I still have no idea why.

And yes, there are times where there are hundreds of applicants. For most roles at most companies that won't quite be the case, but it can happen. When the system is overwhelmed like this my own recommendation is just to save everyone some time, pick a random number of resumes that you *can* commit to reviewing, and mass-reject the rest. It sucks, but it sucks less than every other alternative.

Finally, just to dispel the urban legend, there is no ATS-scanner. I mean of course such things *do* exist and are used by some large companies who get tends of thousands of resumes, but outside of that? I have been involved in hiring in six companies and I've never seen it. I've never spoken to anyone who has seen it commonly used first-hand. Stop worrying about "getting past the scanner". Your resume goes into a folder and if you are lucky a person eventually looks at it. What else is there?

Now some might counter that AI-based resume graders are rapidly becoming a thing, and I am sure they are. But there is no reason to think the tired "beat he ATS" advice from years past applies to this new world. Nor is it clear that anyone is using these systems in a way that requires, or is even possible to, game.

# To be continued

Well, we're over 3500 words already and good lord, we're nowhere near done. I think we'll stop here and pick up next time with more on resumes, interviews, and what on earth it actually means when people tell you to network.
