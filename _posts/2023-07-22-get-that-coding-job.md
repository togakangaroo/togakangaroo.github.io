# Preface

So far during my career, I've designed software developer hiring processes at three different companies. I've personally conducted a couple hundred interviews, I've run teams that have conducted thousands, and I've spoken on hiring at conferences. I also have mentored people for fifteen years, am involved in several online organizations based around helping people progress or move into tech, and - while CTO at Operation Spark bootcamp - have spent months helping run the job hunt phase of the program. In one form or another, I think about this stuff every day, and so people ask me for job hunt advice a lot.

Now I've been meaning to write this article for a long time and I've got 6000 words of notes alone; so before we launch into this tome, let me just say that I very much acknowledge that my own experience is very much *not* that of someone trying to break through out of school or bootcamp. At this point, its not even similar to most senior developers. In addition, even expert advice, when offered on such an activity which you do relatively infrequently and where any feedback on whether your decisions are sound, is precisely the sort flagged by researchers in Thinking Fast and Slow as being no better than random.

Yet people keep asking me for advice on job hunt.

And I do think that over the years I have developed a set of mostly common sense things that I tell people, and they do seem to find it helpful. There's a limit to how much you should listen to me, but here it is.

# Mindset

Let's not be shy about this, Job hunt is a Sisyphean task.

Except of course it is not. Sisyphus was the damned ancient Greek king cursed to roll a boulder up hill without ever reaching the top. A thing can only be Sisyphean if it is impossible to attain your goals. Otherwise, it is just hard. And job hunt is. You are best served getting into the right frame of mind.

It's not hard because you have to push a heavy boulder, it is hard because every part of the job hunt will be all about failure. Sure, in the end you suddenly achieve your goals, but right up till there...well it sucks.

But what if job hunt is **not primarily** about that?

So you've learned a lot about programming and have done projects. That's great! But that's not the full set of skills needed to get the job. That's a different set. Your *primary* goal is to build up the skills you need to get a job.

## The Funnel

At its core, a job hunt is marketing, is it not? You are marketing yourself.

Have you ever heard marketing or sales people talk about "the funnel"? The idea is that there is a series of stages, at each stage a decision is made and you other progress or get eliminated. At each stage therefore the number of people passing through gets smaller and the chances of any one of them reaching the end successfully gets higher.

So its really more of a sieve than a funnel, but I guess marketing folk aren't known for their nomenclature. (Also feel free to visualize this as a video game...but like, without checkpoints and you never get a chainsaw.)

The job hunt too is a funnel. Here is a rough list of stages you have to get through.

- Your resume needs to get looked at. That means someone has to actually be manning the hiring apparatus. You'll be shocked how often things have there's simply not someone on the other side. I would wager this is the case with 20-50% of all job postings. This isn't usually something insidious; no one needs to "harvest your resume" or anything like that. Just plain ol' disorganization and the fact that things change.
- Alternately, they might have gotten so many resumes that they simply couldn't review every one. In fact, I encourage people in that position to pick at random a comfortable number of resumes they actually can review and mass-reject the rest. It sucks, but it sucks less than any alternative.
- Next, your resume should stack up well enough against others to be selected for a phone screen.
- Of course you have to be able to carry on a conversation in a phone screen and demonstrate enough to be passed through to an interview.
- Then there's the rounds of interview - each a stage in itself. Let's be conservative and say there are three rounds. The details will vary, but lets say this includes a technical conversation with the hiring manager, a leetcode-style coding test, and a behavioral interview panel. At each point you might get eliminated and you're really rolling a die whether your preformance matched up with their expectations.
- Now say that you get to the end of the interview process...well that's no guarantee you get an offer! There are other people also moving through the process. If they did it correctly, only a couple should reach the end, but either way, the offer goes to just one.
- Then of course the offer has to be good enough that you're willing to take it.
- And finally, at every point in time there's the possibility - small yet real - of the job simply disappearing, hiring being frozen, the hiring manager or recruiter leaving, or people just plain dropping the ball.

This is a key concept to understand and we will revisit this throughout. There are things you can do to improve your odds at just about any stage, but time spent improving in one area is time not spent on another. You have to learn how to think about these odds and how they interact. Unless you're an ace at Bayesian probability, **your intution here is probably wrong**.

## Job Hunt Skills

Now if you have amazing, preexisting marketing and sales skills you probably don't need to hear any of this. If you are incredible at networking and can cold-call sell a wool coat to a sheep, you don't need my advice and you should just go do the things you already know how to do far better than I. But for the rest of you (or the marketing wizes who are reading this for "research", good for you), lets talk about what I mean by "job hunt skills".

> *“There’s nothing to applying at all. All I need to do is tailor my resume and click submit.”*
>  -- a mentee

Yeah, it's not that simple. What is this entirely different set of skills anyways? Let's do another list.

- Goal setting and sticking to a schedule. Including the ability to set small-yet-achievable short-term goals, set commitments, do regular accountability check-ins, and adjust as needed.

  This is the key to improving at *most things* and rarely something - outside of practicing sports or music - that people do explicitly.

- Ability to find jobs to simply find apply to.

  Ever look at a job board and dejectedly feel like none of these listings are a fit? It's not just you. This influences the rate at which you fill up that funnel and how many chances at this stuff per week do you get.

- The mere act of applying is an emotional roller coaster. You have to put yourself out there, you get hopeful, open up yourself to dejection.

  As humans, we try to avoid these situations. You have to desensitize yourself so that it simply doesn't sting so bad. Again this directly influences that front-of-funnel, how frequently you will need to take breaks, and the likelihood of you giving up and walking away from the whole thing. No one **wants** to apply to 3000 jobs and you very likely won't have to, but wouldn't it be nice if such a high number didn't give you all-night indigestion?

- You have to get to a point where it is easy to write and talk about yourself.

  It's not a natural thing for most people, yet what much of the interview and application process consists of. Getting good at this is going to affect most of your process. Your application, phone screen, interviews are in no small part exactly this!

- Following up.

  This is key to get people to actually pick up and look at your resume where they otherwise might not.

- Cold reach-out.

  Contacting individuals you do not know, requesting favors of connections or information can often feel socially prohibitive. Yet it is key to several networking strategies that increase your chances during interviews and ensure that you are applying to jobs where you are likely to be considered. It is a worthwhile tool to have in your pocket

- Researching companies and industries.

  Most people have no idea how to do real research. It's not ten minutes browsing the company website. Understanding how to join communities and how to conduct informational/reverse interviews are key here and take a decent amount of practice.

- The ability to have engaging conversation live and asking good questions.

  Of course a must for interview, phone screen, and offer stages as well as supporting techniques in many others. In these post-COVID pandemic days, we all need some work to improve here.

- Ability to talk about technology.

  It's great that you know X, Y, and Z. But can you actually demonstrate it live in a conversation? When the questions people ask are not those you practiced in terms that are different than what you might be used to?

- Leetcode-style coding. Or live-coding, or take-home-project coding.

  Well you knew this would be on the list as it affects those interview stages, but you're probably surprised how small a proportion of this list it really is.

- Network building and maintenance

  The core of "networking". **How** do you actually "build a network"? What is one? How do you use it? How do you tend it and grow it?

  This again, affects the few stages at the front of your funnel directly and all others indirectly. For example in the course of networking, you will get lots of practice talking to people in industry. Surely that will affect interviews as well!

This is a lot - almost an overwhelming amount - of stuff! Most of it is outside most people's comfort zone. So how do we climb a mountain like this when it is both uncomfortable and emotionally draining? Habit and organization are key

# You have to get organized

Yeah, ironically this advice is to you but not the companies you're applying to. It sucks, but - as I mentioned above - for some significant proportion of job postings you have no real chance no matter how good your job hunt skills are.

There's a saying in advertising that half of all money spent on it is wasted, the problem is that you don't know which half. The same is going to (with some caveats) apply hear as well. And if we're taking lessons from marketing, then what did the advertising industry do in the late 90s to deal with this conundrum? Well, with adtech, they started to...

## Track everything

If your primary goal is to build up job hunting skills, your **secondary goal** is to gather data that can be used to guide you further in the job hunting process.

I've been paying a lot of attention recently on a forum of dozens of very high-level and senior people looking for and sharing job hunting tips. Here is an example of the sort of thing they are regularly posting.

Now your numbers will of course be very different, but at a bare minimum this is the sort of thing you should be able to generate at any point in time and with little effort. Note this does not mean - as people have told me in the past - "I can check my email and see where I applied" or "well Indeed has this nice tool to show you what stage you're at". You have access to a lot more data than such tools offer.

Remember those weekly accountability and commitment meetings I mentioned? Well these work best if you can set goals and discuss success in terms of numbers. Ideally, all of the following are things that you should be able to give weekly updates on.

- Exactly how many places you've applied, in the past week? Ever?
- Exactly which stage in the process are you with each application.
- Where have you followed up and when?
- Which cover letter and/or resume did you use for every job application? If they have a custom form with essay questions, what exactly did you put in there?
- What industry is the company in and what they do? How large is the company?
- How excited you are about the opportunity? (Putting a number to this is great when you are determining how to prioritize follow-ups!)
- Which skills are the jobs you are looking at demanding? Which are seen as nice-to-haves?

  Note that this especially presents an opportunity to make data work for you. If you can code, you should code! Don't just copy-paste, standardize things. If you have a category for "Javascript" and they're asking for "ReactJs" or "Node", then that still counts as Javascript. You should be making bar charts of this stuff and using this to guide what you invest your time into!

This is all starting to sound a lot like a spreadsheet, does it not? Probably a good idea to have one.

Ultimately it's a good thing though. With this get-the-data framing, you take the terrifying prospect of hundreds of job applications and convert it into a positive source of much-needed data.

Yes, all this means That you are not going to get a job within the first six weeks of job hunt. Forget about that prospect. First, you need data.

## It's all about cadence

Here is the general shape of the job-hunt I am proposing:

First, you find a schedule that you can stick to. Next, you find a baseline of what sort of effort you can maintain long term.

In its simplest form, you want to be able to say something like "I have maintained it for a while and I know that I can apply to X amount of jobs per week without breaking a sweat." `X` is going to be different for you than for others, it can be very low or quite high, and it **should not be guessed at**; you need to have actual numbers on a spreadsheet of your experience that you can point to. And you absolutely need to know what `X` is, because once you do, you can start tweaking.

Now remember the aforementioned accountability meetings? You want those. Use a mentor, your school/bootcamp, a friend, a group of others on the job search, or even a formal [Job Search Council](https://www.phyl.org/join-jsc). At each meeting, you review your week, review your numbers blame-free, make any adjustments (eg. is `X` actually lower/higher than you initially proposed?) and commit to some goals for your next week. What goals you ask? Well, this is where the tweaking comes in. Say your number `X` is 25. You know, that using a reasonable amount of effort, in the time available, you could certainly apply to 25 jobs each week. You decide that you want to increase the odds that your resume is actually looked at. Follow-ups are exactly such a tool as we'll discuss. They can be time intensive however, and require their own set of skills to get working effectively. What if for next week you committed to scaling back to only 15 job applications, but you did 5 followups to jobs you applied to over the previous two weeks? In the following week, can you go back up to 20 job applications, while maintaining the follow ups?

A cadence gives you a ratchet to improvement. Be honest with yourself and set your goals well, and you will always be improving.

Finally here, I'd like to address the focus on job applications versus other strategies. I emphasize with the desire to avoid an activity that is for most deeply ego-bruising, but lets be honest, ultimately all roads lead to Rome. Applying to jobs is the surest way to make sure that you actually do something measurable, it works as a last ditch effort, and frankly - it trains you quite well on many of the skills you'll need to succeed in other areas of the job hunt. There is really only one thing that you **must do** to get pretty much any job: You have to apply.
