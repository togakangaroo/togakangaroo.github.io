# Preface

So far during my career, I've designed software developer hiring processes at three different companies. I've personally conducted a couple hundred interviews, I've run teams that have conducted thousands, and I've spoken on hiring at conferences. I also have mentored people for fifteen years, am involved in several online organizations based around helping people progress or move into tech, and - while CTO at Operation Spark bootcamp - have spent months helping run the job hunt phase of the program. In one form or another, I think about this stuff every day, and so people ask me for job hunt advice a lot.

Now I've been meaning to write this article for a long time and I've got 6000 words of notes alone; so before we launch into this tome, let me just say that I very much acknowledge that my own experience is very much *not* that of someone trying to break through out of school or bootcamp. At this point, its not even similar to most senior developers. In addition, even expert advice, when offered on such an activity which you do relatively infrequently and where any feedback on whether your decisions are sound, is precisely the sort flagged by researchers in Thinking Fast and Slow as being no better than random.

Yet people keep asking me for advice on job hunt.

And I do think that over the years I have developed a set of mostly common sense things that I tell people, and they do seem to find it helpful. There's a limit to how much you should listen to me, but here it is.

# Mindset

Let's not be shy about this, Job hunt is a Sisyphean task.

Except of course it is not. Sisyphus was the damned ancient Greek king cursed to roll a boulder up hill without ever reaching the top. A thing can only be Sisyphean if it is impossible to attain your goals. Otherwise, it is just hard. And job hunt is. You are best served getting into the right frame of mind.

It's not hard because you have to push a heavy boulder, it is hard because every part of the job hunt will be all about failure. Sure, in the end you suddenly achieve your goals, but right up till there...well it sucks.

But what if job hunt is **not primarily** about that?

So you've learned a lot about programming and have done projects. That's great! But that's not the full set of skills needed to get the job. That's a different set. Your *primary* goal is to build up the skills you need to get a job.

## The Funnel

At its core, a job hunt is marketing, is it not? You are marketing yourself.

Have you ever heard marketing or sales people talk about "the funnel"? The idea is that there is a series of stages, at each stage a decision is made and you other progress or get eliminated. At each stage therefore the number of people passing through gets smaller and the chances of any one of them reaching the end successfully gets higher.

So its really more of a sieve than a funnel, but I guess marketing folk aren't known for their nomenclature. (Also feel free to visualize this as a video game...but like, without checkpoints and you never get a chainsaw.)

The job hunt too is a funnel. Here is a rough list of stages you have to get through.

- Your resume needs to get looked at. That means someone has to actually be manning the hiring apparatus. You'll be shocked how often things have there's simply not someone on the other side. I would wager this is the case with 20-50% of all job postings. This isn't usually something insidious; no one needs to "harvest your resume" or anything like that. Just plain ol' disorganization and the fact that things change.
- Alternately, they might have gotten so many resumes that they simply couldn't review every one. In fact, I encourage people in that position to pick at random a comfortable number of resumes they actually can review and mass-reject the rest. It sucks, but it sucks less than any alternative.
- Next, your resume should stack up well enough against others to be selected for a phone screen.
- Of course you have to be able to carry on a conversation in a phone screen and demonstrate enough to be passed through to an interview.
- Then there's the rounds of interview - each a stage in itself. Let's be conservative and say there are three rounds. The details will vary, but lets say this includes a technical conversation with the hiring manager, a leetcode-style coding test, and a behavioral interview panel. At each point you might get eliminated and you're really rolling a die whether your preformance matched up with their expectations.
- Now say that you get to the end of the interview process...well that's no guarantee you get an offer! There are other people also moving through the process. If they did it correctly, only a couple should reach the end, but either way, the offer goes to just one.
- Then of course the offer has to be good enough that you're willing to take it.
- And finally, at every point in time there's the possibility - small yet real - of the job simply disappearing, hiring being frozen, the hiring manager or recruiter leaving, or people just plain dropping the ball.

This is a key concept to understand and we will revisit this throughout. There are things you can do to improve your odds at just about any stage, but time spent improving in one area is time not spent on another. You have to learn how to think about these odds and how they interact. Unless you're an ace at Bayesian probability, **your intution here is probably wrong**.

## Job Hunt Skills

Now if you have amazing, preexisting marketing and sales skills you probably don't need to hear any of this. If you are incredible at networking and can cold-call sell a wool coat to a sheep, you don't need my advice and you should just go do the things you already know how to do far better than I. But for the rest of you (or the marketing wizes who are reading this for "research", good for you), lets talk about what I mean by "job hunt skills".

Yeah, it's not that simple. Let's do another list.
