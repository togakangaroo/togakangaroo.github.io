So far during my career, I've designed software developer hiring processes at three different companies. I've personally conducted a couple hundred interviews, I've run teams that have conducted thousands, and I've spoken on hiring at conferences. I also have mentored people for fifteen years, am involved in several online organizations based around helping people progress or move into tech, and - while CTO at Operation Spark bootcamp - have spent months helping run the job hunt phase of the program. In one form or another, I think about this stuff every day, and so people ask me for job hunt advice a lot.

Now I've been meaning to write this article for a long time and I've got 6000 words of notes alone; so before we launch into this tome, let me just say that I very much acknowledge that my own experience is very much *not* that of someone trying to break through out of school or bootcamp. At this point, its not even similar to most senior developers. In addition, even expert advice, when offered on such an activity which you do relatively infrequently and where any feedback on whether your decisions are sound, is precisely the sort flagged by researchers in Thinking Fast and Slow as being no better than random.

Yet people keep asking me for advice on job hunt.

And I do think that over the years I have developed a set of mostly common sense things that I tell people, and they do seem to find it helpful. There's a limit to how much you should listen to me, but here it is.
