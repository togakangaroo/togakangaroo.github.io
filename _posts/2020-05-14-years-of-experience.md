I was asked recently about "years of experience in tech X" requirements in job postings making early-career people feel inadequate. We all know the daunting Catch-22 faced by entry-level developers

> How do I get experience when I need experience to get the job that gives me experience?

But this extends even beyond that fearsome point to people who have one, two, three years of experience - ones that could potentially be solid mid-level even nudging at senior-level developers. It is something that ties into the concept of impostor syndrome but also the idea that this industry tends to be terrible at [all parts of hiring](/2017/11/03/take-home-interviewing-tests.html).

So here's the deal:

*People misunderstand the X years of experience thing a lot.*

And by that I don't just mean job seekers.
I think it’s perfectly reasonable to advertise a position requesting that someone has 3 or 5 years of industry experience - after all someone at 3 years experience coding most of the week has 6000 hours of experience coding professionally. At 5 years there’s a possibility of them being at a senior level. There are a lot of things you learn in that time around workflows, the industry, and coding itself so it’s somewhat reasonable of a filter if you can’t afford to invest in growing talent.
I think it’s also reasonable - if you’re say a Ruby shop - to say that someone should have experience with Ruby. Ideally you can let someone learn on the job but for a lot of situations that might not be feasible so you want to make sure they’re up to date on the tools and workflows specific to the language.
What I think is really silly is insisting someone have X amount of years of experience in a specific tech. There are some exceptions of course but not many. I know plenty of people who have been doing c# since it came out that don’t have any particular insight into it after all.
While many companies do make this mistake with writing job postings I find that there is often a soft of instinctive understanding of this and that is a point they are often wiling to be most flexible on.
