I'm George Mauer

This is my low effort blog. Mostly about software development. I regularly do presentations at various usergroups. I sometimes do them to my cat.

## Bio

I am a software developer, speaker, teacher, writer, and comedian with an interest in the various techniques that can make software simple, extensible, and communicative. I have worked in software consulting in all sorts of positions for over a decade. I am currently CTO at the [Operation Spark](https://operationspark.org/) code school in New Orleans. I mentor with [Operation Code (unrelated)](https://operationcode.org/), write, teach, and speak regularly on Javascript, C#, testing, interviewing, etc at conferences, usergroups, and to my cat (singular - the other one won't listen to me).

[Find me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/togakangaroo) or try out the Disqus forms on my posts and let me know if they work. In general, it's not very hard to find a way to contact me.

## Talks I've Done / Do

### The Most Accessible Pizza Pie

[Article](http://georgemauer.net/2019/11/04/dominos-v-robles.html), [Slides with Notes](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/19DjTcnDmYbToa4x_xaOZ7HRUM-ZF1Ol8LYstdSyfTrQ/edit#slide=id.g65459e8168_0_92)

The tech world is abuzz with the final word rendered in the Dominos vs Robles web accessibility case. Anyone can be sued for ADA compliance violations now! No one knows what to do! It's chaos! Reading the ruling brings things into sharper focus. We will go over what the ruling actually was, why it was issued, and what this means for us web developers. All from DEFINITELY NOT A LAWYER!

@ UI Arch Conf, Front End Party

### TDD With No More Tears

[Article](http://georgemauer.net/2019/12/02/tdd-with-no-more-tears.html), [Sample Code](https://github.com/togakangaroo/tdd-with-no-tears) [Slides with Notes](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mvzBX_vYvcfqSPNpMmYSwRzy__IstOfDiClxa_9iMRc/edit#slide=id.g5dfe60e86f_0_82)

Unit testing is hard to get right. Are you testing too much? Too little? How do you write tests that aren't a waste of time? Isn't testing supposed to enable refactoring? Then why do they seem to be in the way? What's this BDD thing I keep hearing about? Do we need to learn yet another tool?

This talk goes into the philosophy behind unit testing in general and test-driven development in particular. Discuss how to keep things simple yet useful and showcase a strategy for writing tests that achieve our goals without wasting anybody's time.

@ AgileShift Houston 2020, GDG New Orleans, Surge Dev Meeting, SQL Saturday Baton Rouge

### Someone Asked Me To Talk About Open Source

[Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/19FGLKFGa8PCVXdyRtAmGVNgjyqxEer2JUxWmPttw__Q/)

A lecture prepared for Tulane communications students introducing them to the idea of open source software, how it works, its history, licensing structures, and major concerns of the time.

@ Tulane Communications

### What's the Deal With Javascript

[Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18jzlXGe2gik75bAWC6BfZP1FUXDSTinZa1T7eA9jYGQ/)

A lecture and small workshop introducing Computer Science students to the what and why of Javascript.

@ Tulane Computer Science

### React Context, Storybook, and Other Tips

[Slides as a Storybook](http://georgemauer.net/react-context-storybook/storybook-static/)

The new React Context API is incredibly powerful and yet little understood. This talk explains how the concept is really just a form of the extremely-powerful but rarely-used technique of dynamic scoping, and the many powers and uses this enables. And it does all this in a Storybook!

@ Front End Party, Gnocode

### CQRS, Lite and Otherwise

[Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LUaS3ABgkw5tjdofnerNNq1EWLU41Zb2nOraoRprt1U/edit#slide=id.p)

A popular buzzword, CQRS is often misunderstood and more often misused. Less of an architecture than a set of related techniques and an architectural flavor, it is an important and powerful technique to have in your arsenal. This talk discusses traditional CQRS, breaks it down to its essence, and discusses a lightweight alternative by which an application can be created without much of the overhead while maintaining a straightforward transition path to a fully CQRS style.

@ Gnocode, Baton Rouge .Net Usergroup, Sql Saturday Baton Rouge

### History of the Web

[Bibliography](https://gist.github.com/togakangaroo/3309a873a99397d3e54c8bb55e944c5c)

In order to understand things at a deeper level, it often helps to understand why things are the way that they are. And the web is a weird place for a lot of weird reasons. This talk is a deep dive into the history of the development web, with plenty of stories, personalities, and original research. Understand the history of HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and use that understanding to predict where we might go in the future.

### There is No Front End

Less of a talk, more of a rant? There is no such thing as Front End or Back End Development as a job description. Skills? Sure, but not a job. Like I said, less a talk, more of a rant.

@ FrontEnd Party, WFH Conf

[Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1VHIvpUXXFkcE0_MColGeZTl7Jbybxkn0OxgsNYCFJT8/edit#slide=id.p) [Video](https://youtu.be/3m_ECe5COrw?t=121)

Originally a presentation for salespeople, this talk covers a lot of the jargon frequently used by software developers, dbas, sysadmins, and other technical specialists, attempting to give the audience a high level understanding of exactly what all this stuff actually means.

@ Barcamp Nola, Internal meetings

### I Can Hack Spreadsheets and So Can You

[Article](http://georgemauer.net/2017/10/07/csv-injection.html)

### Just Use HTML Forms Already

[Published(!) Article](http://www.codemag.com/Article/1701091)
[Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wswqElnMyaou4vgWqVXBf-yfQBPHU2Ob9x6delYgSpE/edit#slide=id.p)
[Code](https://github.com/togakangaroo/just-forms)

In the age of the javascript framework, its worth to stop and ask - what was wrong with simple HTML forms? Sure there were reasons that we stopped using them, but do those reasons still hold? Covers this as well as some simple and natural alternatives to model binding, unidirectional data-flow, and javascript templating frameworks. Oh and also how the appraoches are not mutually exclusive and can be used with any of thos.

[Npm Package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gimgen)

For whatever reason, I decided to go absurdly deep with javascript generators. Really Really deep. I've even created my own micro-library. In this talk we walk throught he concept of generators, how it relates to asynchronous programming, co-routines, and then demo the weird, thought-provoking, and useful(?) patterns enabled by a library like gimgen.

As far as I'm aware, I have come up with the best appraoch of doing css-only tabs. Optional url-syncing, basic HTML, no hard coding anything in your css, and completely zero javascript. Really.
