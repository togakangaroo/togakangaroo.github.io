I'm George Mauer

This is my low effort blog. Mostly about software development. I regularly do presentations at various usergroups. I sometimes do them to my cat.

## Bio

I am a software developer, speaker, teacher, writer, and comedian with an interest in the various techniques that can make software simple, extensible, and communicative. I'm currently a Director of Development with [Surge Consulting Group](http://www.surgeforward.com/), a part of [Catalyte](https://catalyte.io/). I teach and help build curriculum with [Operation Spark](https://operationspark.org/). I mentor with [Operation Code (unrelated)](https://operationcode.org/). I speak regularly on Javascript, C#, MVC, testing, interviewing, etc at conferences, usergroups, and to my cat (singular - the other one won't listen to me).

[Find me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/togakangaroo) or try out the Disqus forms on my posts and let me know if they work. In general, it's not very hard to find a way to contact me.

## Talks I've Done / Do

### CQRS, Lite and Otherwise

[Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LUaS3ABgkw5tjdofnerNNq1EWLU41Zb2nOraoRprt1U/edit#slide=id.p)

A popular buzzword, CQRS is often misunderstood and more often misused. Less of an architecture than a set of related techniques and an architectural flavor, it is an important and powerful technique to have in your arsenal. This talk discusses traditional CQRS, breaks it down to its essence, and discusses a lightweight alternative by which an application can be created without much of the overhead while maintaining a straightforward transition path to a fully CQRS style.

@ Gnocode

### History of the Web

[More Conferency Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16SCFHyzGtVoJMvUCUBuJTCZMnUDi7e0bWWw0XsNXZmg/edit#slide=id.p)
[More Studenty Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qUiHKZtDV-HB8rrP3EUU0HwoP4z2mSKrx8hLguB55Rc/edit#slide=id.p)
[Bibliography](https://gist.github.com/togakangaroo/3309a873a99397d3e54c8bb55e944c5c)

In order to understand things at a deeper level, it often helps to understand why things are the way that they are. And the web is a weird place for a lot of weird reasons. This talk is a deep dive into the history of the development web, with plenty of stories, personalities, and original research. Understand the history of HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and use that understanding to predict where we might go in the future.

@ Jazzcon, Sql Saturday, Gnocode, Active 8, Technology Leadership Summit, Barcamp Nola, Opspark, Operation Code, Many various usergroups

### There is No Front End

Less of a talk, more of a rant? There is no such thing as Front End or Back End Development as a job description. Skills? Sure, but not a job. Like I said, less a talk, more of a rant.

@ FrontEnd Party

[Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1VHIvpUXXFkcE0_MColGeZTl7Jbybxkn0OxgsNYCFJT8/edit#slide=id.p)

### Personal Security on the Internet

[Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YccuuWBiGZaoRkHjaoyQMhnZRfXY9av72TtZpUJa1WA/edit#slide=id.p)

Born out of a presentation to bootcampers on personal and web application security and why they are now on the front lines, this lightweight and well recieved talk covers such topics as proper password storage, password management, https, and basic device security.

@ Barcamp Nola, Several usergroups, Opspark

### Tech Terms for Non-Technical Techies

[Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1z9j9jUH8wgRcV__5SubmkEA9YZe2wIDb25Mf8DwD7QI/edit#slide=id.p)

Originally a presentation for salespeople, this talk covers a lot of the jargon frequently used by software developers, dbas, sysadmins, and other technical specialists, attempting to give the audience a high level understanding of exactly what all this stuff actually means.

@ Barcamp Nola, Internal meetings

### I Can Hack Spreadsheets and So Can You

[Article](http://georgemauer.net/2017/10/07/csv-injection.html)
[Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1gzCoRUjyUOc8FdZmb4sIj9_ERjh-YgzgMAEqHZNm4ag/edit)

A presentation of my shocking discovery of CSV injection and the absurd degree to which it can cause affect nearly all applications and users.

@ Front End Party, NolaSec

### Just Use HTML Forms Already

[Published(!) Article](http://www.codemag.com/Article/1701091)
[Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wswqElnMyaou4vgWqVXBf-yfQBPHU2Ob9x6delYgSpE/edit#slide=id.p)
[Code](https://github.com/togakangaroo/just-forms)

In the age of the javascript framework, its worth to stop and ask - what was wrong with simple HTML forms? Sure there were reasons that we stopped using them, but do those reasons still hold? Covers this as well as some simple and natural alternatives to model binding, unidirectional data-flow, and javascript templating frameworks. Oh and also how the appraoches are not mutually exclusive and can be used with any of thos.

@ Baton Rouge Usergroup, Gnocode, Jazzcon

### Gimgen - Deep Dive Into Javascript Generators

[Code (with a full explanation)](https://github.com/togakangaroo/gimgen)
[Demo Page](http://georgemauer.net/gimgen/)
[Interactive Slides](http://georgemauer.net/gimgen-preso/#/main)

For whatever reason, I decided to go absurdly deep with javascript generators. Really Really deep. I've even created my own micro-library. In this talk we walk throught he concept of generators, how it relates to asynchronous programming, co-routines, and then demo the weird, thought-provoking, and useful(?) patterns enabled by a library like gimgen.

@ Front End Party, Jazzcon

### Interviewing Developers

[Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1AQE0cl3pUev2j2z3PN1aZI8fYOSFlD5MQkspZkJEfCs/edit#slide=id.p)

I have personally conducted well over 120 interviews and set up the Surge interviewing process that has seen many more. This talk is about the philosophy of this humanizing process, why I believe it has worked absurdly well for us, and some of the great things that it enables.

### CSS Only Tabs

[Article](http://georgemauer.net/2016/07/15/css-only-tabs)

[Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15EB5cnDU63POFWIO04uHmhobrMGfKRV7rnayX2tjiM8/edit#slide=id.p)

As far as I'm aware, I have come up with the best appraoch of doing css-only tabs. Optional url-syncing, basic HTML, no hard coding anything in your css, and completely zero javascript. Really.

@ Barcamp Nola, Jazzcon, Front End Party

### Be the Es6iest

@ Houston Techfest, various usergroups
