Your *primary* goal is to build up the skills you need to get a job. You are going to largely focus on one at a time. Your *secondary* goal is to gather data that can be used to guide you further in the process. This means you need to be fastidious with your record-keeping. The job will be an *outcome* of your improved skills and ability to guide your path in an intelligent manner.

As far as job-hunting skills, the items on the list and ordering chan change of course, but this is what I recommend to start with (again, focusing one or at *most* two at a time):
* Goal setting and sticking to a schedule
* Ability to find jobs to apply to (difficulty here is making the process seem far more tortuous than it needs to)
* Desensitize yourself so that applying to a job is not this big emotional commitment (this is making you quit when you should keep going)
* Get to a point where it is easy to write about yourself (largely in the form of cover letters)
* Following up
* Cold reaching out
* Researching companies and Informational interviews/Reverse interviews
* Talking about yourself and asking questions live
* Interviewing skills (this is probably several different categories)
  - Leetcode-style coding
  - Project-style coding
  - Talking about yourseof
  - Talking about tech
  - Behavioral interviews in front of a panel
  - Asking questions
* Network building
* Network maintenance
* Other self promotion

How exactly this works out is going to vary (the point of the weekly planning meetings is to make adjustments to the details) but maybe something like this
* First just start setting realistic goals and schedule. Differentiate between must-hit and stretch goals. Must-hit goals must be hit, set them lower if need be. For accountability, a weekly standing meeting to review how you did in the previous week and make adjustments.
* Apply and take notes. You need to practice setting/hitting goals and sticking to a schedule so that is what you are practicing. It doesn't matter if you think you have no chance at the job. Obviously you *want* to have a chance, but that's not the goal. I recommend a policy such as "Start by setting a timer for 40 minutes and try to find a job you want to apply to. If the timer goes off and you haven't found a job to apply to yet, set a timer for 15 minutes. You *have* to find a job to apply to in the next 15 minutes. If you don't find one, then pick one at random, you still have to apply." (Of course take notes on how that goes)
* Slowly start cranking up the numbers on how much you're applying until you have a clear track record where you can say you can apply to X jobs a week, and its not difficult - this creates bandwidth for focusing on the next goals
* Start setting goals around following up. Get it to a point where you have no problem doing applying *and* following up in a timely manner on a significant proportion of your applications (maybe 25% is a good number)
* Start setting goals around cold-reaching out to people and achieve these
* Once you are no longer terrified of cold-reaching out, start setting goals around requesting informational interviews
* Do lots of informational interviews, tweak how you talk about yourself and how you talk to others to get the sort of outcomes you want
* Mock interviews, plenty of them (this might have to happen earlier in the process or in parallel to some stuff)
* Set goals around creating networks of people who you will get invested in your success. This is going to be closely connected to the informational interview steps but with a different focus - now you not only want to get info out of them but you want them to be invested in your success
* Start working about how you can maintain those networks you are building so that those people are actually thinking of you more often

-----------
things to help improve the chances:
* The 2 hour job search book has been recommended a lot as a sort of guide on how to network

* Be really really organized. Write down everything, have a spreadsheet of where you applied and when, when and how you followed up, interviewed, etc. Set weekly commitments - how many jobs will you apply to in a given week? Followups? Studying? What time will you spend on your own projects?

* Don’t neglect follow ups. Find a way to get in touch with someone. If you don’t have an email address then linkedin stalking, if you can’t connect with someone there then guess emails

* Do research on companies and industries. Not two minutes worth of website scanning, real research, talk to people in those industries. When you write your cover letter customize it to what people at that company/in that industry/location are probably dealing with and be direct in how your specific experiences can help. Your cover letter should not simply reflect the job description and your resume back at them (https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-i-learned-from-doing-60-technical-interviews-in-30-days/ has a good example of a cover letter that stands out)

* Don’t just click-apply. Remember, the easier it is for you to apply the easier it is for a million other people

* Lately I’ve been encouraging people to focus for a week on an industry or a location. Do research on this a week or two in advance - join online communities for that location/industry and find out who the movers and the shakers are. Ask them for a chat so that you can customize things for people like them. Network network network

* That’s just the foot-in-the-door-of-the-process stuff. Next you have to actually interview. Be practicing interviewing skills. Cracking the Code Interview, be trying to get good at #daily-programmer problems (there’s hundreds of them in a standard format if you search the channel). Post your answers and talk about them. Get used to talking about code

* Open source is great from the point of view of getting some practice, getting some talking points and experience, and from networking. But you have to do it with those things in mind. Pick your open source work to optimize for those goals

So the thing with networking is ultimately what you want to do is get a network of people who are invested in your success and therefore pass you opportunities you wouldn't have heard of otherwise. Ideally they're well connected into places you're not and are likely to hear about stuff and make sure someone actually looks at your damn resume

if that's the goal...well you can imagine there's a lot of different ways of going about it.

Having serious numbers of applications is still important because I really believe that - unless you're already preternaturally good at networking (and then you don't need advice) - there's a certain level of stuff you have to go through to realistically land a job. Applying a lot at first is good because you
- Are forced to build processes and schedules you can be consistent with
- Are forced to write about yourself a lot
- Are doing focused interview prep while you do this
- Get a viewpoint and understanding of the market out there
- Get data on how your job application process works
- See point 1 again cause that's a really big one.

Plenty of people get lucky within the round of mass-applying and frankly good for them. If you can get your foot in the door that way that's great.
If you've done that though, and you feel like its not working there are other places you can take it to. Networking is the obvious next step and if you think about it in the terms I said above hopefully you can see there's a lot more room for creativity than maybe you think

For ideas, it is helpful to focus in on an area - perhaps even artificially. So for example, lets say you decide you might want to work at a company that does a lot of data science stuff. Do you have connections to that industry? Probably not, so you need to get some. Take 2 weeks in which you apply less, but you spend the remainder of the time building out that network.

So what I might do for example is spend one day listening to some podcasts, doing some research and learn what data science actually is and map out some of the concepts and players in the space. I would look to find data science based communities and join them. I'd try to read the backlog in those communities and keep an eye out for who the people who participate regularly are. I'd introduce myself and make myself visible by asking some thoughtful questions, or even just occasionally posting a fun meme. I'd maybe decide to do a project where I analyzed my own stats from 300 applications and I'd ask questions or for help with it and do a good job. I'd ask for informational interviews. The people who I end up talking to more are likely to be more social people who are fairly well connected. I can then start side conversations with them.

I wouldn't hit them up for a job, I'd just talk to them, ask for advice, ask questions, be humble. Ideally they take a likeing and grow invested and we stay in touc
