# The reality from the hiring manager's side

There is a few things helpful to understand about the other side of the table.

First, job postings. I assume you've heard are rarely lists of concrete requirements. Understand that what happens a lot of the time is that you have an overworked manager or team lead who is asking repeatedly for help. Eventually - after navigating all sorts of internal politics - they manage to get approval to hire. An HR representatives asks them what they need and ask what exactly they need. The manager looks around and replies with a list of tech that is a combination of what they are using (since they likely won't have too much time to onboard) and things they are having issues with and desperately wish someone would take that problem off their hands.

HR takes that, slaps a custom preamble on, and posts the job, sending the hiring manager a link to the opportunity in Lever or in Greenhouse or Indeed or some other ATS wishing them the best of luck.

Note that first, the job posting is rarely well thought through. A decent amount of hiring is for teams and projects that don't even exist yet. It's hardly surprising that some postings will ask for the moon. Now as hiring kicks into gear, the organization will often get a better idea of what they want, yet the hiring manager often has relatively little control over the job posting itself. Even when organizationally there isn't an HR department to get in the way, they might simply not know where or have no access to edit it. They will very often have no control over where a posting appears after it's been picked up by job description reposting services, and no power to make updates.

    If you are yourself green, consider what this means. Requirements are not what they seem; they are all too often wish lists. You've probably heard before that you should limit yourself only to job postings that match your skills exactly. That is true! It is rarely a well thought through hard line. As a guideline, a completely green developer will usually have a chance at a role when they ask for 2 or fewer years of experience; a developer with a few years and confidence will have a chance at anything requesting senior skills/5+ years; and beyond that it doesn't matter.

A hiring manager also almost always has other priorities. It is relatively rare that just because you are doing a hiring cycle you have less "other" work. The essence of managerial work is after all such that you usually cannot easily offload it. It is therefore perfectly possible that the ATS goes for days or even weeks unchecked.

Worse, the manager might never have been trained on the ATS. This is surprisingly common and my personal favorite experience here was when I was asked to take over resume screening and first-round interviews at [company name redacted]. After 4 weeks, resumes were coming in a trickle - a couple a week at most. This was very surprising and I checked and re-checked that our job posting had no red flags, was actually appearing in online searches, and there was nothing on Glassdoor to scare people off too bad. I was flummoxed as were others I consulted with. That is, until I found a whole section of the Lever ATS bursting with resumes! People *were* applying, simply most were hidden on the default candidate-review screen. I still have no idea why.

And yes, there are times where there are hundreds of applicants. For most roles at most companies that won't quite be the case, but it can happen. When the system is overwhelmed like this my own recommendation is just to save everyone some time, pick a random number of resumes that you *can* commit to reviewing, and mass-reject the rest. It sucks, but it sucks less than every other alternative.

Finally, just to dispel the urban legend, there is no ATS-scanner. I mean of course such things *do* exist and are used by some large companies who get tends of thousands of resumes, but outside of that? I have been involved in hiring in six companies and I've never seen it. I've never spoken to anyone who has seen it commonly used first-hand. Stop worrying about "getting past the scanner". Your resume goes into a folder and if you are lucky a person eventually looks at it. What else is there?

Now some might counter that AI-based resume graders are rapidly becoming a thing, and I am sure they are. But there is no reason to think the tired "beat he ATS" advice from years past applies to this new world. Nor is it clear that anyone is using these systems in a way that requires, or is even possible to, game.
