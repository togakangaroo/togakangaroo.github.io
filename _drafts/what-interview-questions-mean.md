Wrote this up in our bootcamp slack just now

Some questions - you know they are going to come up in interviews, in job applications, in cover letters. You should understand what the interviewer is looking for and you might as well have a well thought through answer written down ahead of time and worked out and perfected so you can go to that when they do come up.

*Tell me about yourself*
> Understand that from an interviewer point of view, I’m not just looking for an introduction - though that is nice. What I am looking for is to recognize that spark that tags you as someone who is a natural born programmer and engineer. I think of that as being someone who naturally identifies problems and looks for or creates tools and processes to solve them. If you’ve learned to code and made it to the interview, this is probably you! Now show it. Try to emphasize instances in your background which highlight that and how they might relate to why you started on your journey.
*Tell me about a recent project you worked on.*
> What I’m looking for here is not a description of the tech you used or the project features. I think describing the project is important, but keep it short. What I’m looking for is what is going to bring that spark in your eyes when you talk about it. Is it because its an attempt to solve an important problem? Or was there an interesting puzzle? Did something drive your sense of victory and accomplishment? Spend the most time on that. This is what I will visualize as transferring to my project.
*What was a teaming or project management challenge you ran into, and how did you overcome it?* and
*What is a technical challenge you ran into recently, and how did you overcome it?*
> This isn’t about how you overcame adversity. I want to hear about what process you followed in resolving the issue. Your answer probably shouldn’t be “we talked about the issue and resolved it”. Did you decide to hold daily meetings where you spent the first few minutes addressing poorly balanced workloads? Did you spend time reading the documentation back to back while building yourself a playground? Did you remove pieces from the project until you had isolated the issue? What are your thoughts about how and why that process worked? I want to know that not only you can persevere, but that you can have a repeatable process for doing so.


> Describe the hardest technical challenge you’ve had to solve in recent memory

This is a surprisingly difficult question to answer on the spot. Prepare for it ahead of time.

What they are after is to:

1. hear you talk about code so they know what its like working with you where they talk about code all the time
2. hear about what sort of problem you consider “difficult”
3. hear about your process for solving difficult problems

Especially point #3
