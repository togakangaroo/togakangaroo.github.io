                I am a people-and-product obsessed technical leader with over fifteen years experience focusing on architecture, simplicity, and building effective teams. Most recently a Principal Developer and Director at Blocpower, I am always focused on user empathy, building secure yet flexible systems and teams that are empowered to use and improve them.
