                I have been a senior developer with a focus on architecture, simplicity, and building effective teams for over ten years. As a director at Surge consulting I was involved in many operational duties and decisions and - in addition to software development duties - designed and implemented an interview processes and was involved in community building that saw it grow from 20 to about 250 developers.

            <p>
                I speak at conferences, have mentored dozens of software devs, have written popular articles, and been interviewed for a variety of podcasts and publications. I suppose that makes me an industry leader.

                                Developed web applications through a daily use of PHP and ASP. This was typically integrated with an Oracle or MySQL database requiring both back-end and front-end programming in order to generate dynamic, flexible, and maintainable code. Regularly designed and implemented in-browser applications using DHTML and occasionally AJAX. Responsibilities included full-blown site and database design, the writing of documentation, and some light graphic design and image manipulation. Projects were typically done solo or in small teams and ranged the full software development lifecycle of design, implementation, quality assurance, and customer support.
